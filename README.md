# MAE-301-Project
This will be a repository containing data and results from a hypothesis experiment testing the effects of temperature and orientation on 3D printed PLA dog bone samples.

Hypothesis: By raising the temperature of the print material and having a print orientation parallel to the applied load, a 3D printed structure made of PLA plastic will be able to withstand higher stress and strain loads.

Testing will involve printing 5 specimens for each of the 3 orientations (Flat on the print bed, upright, and vertical). The best orientation will be used to test temperature variations. Temperature will be varied from 180-205 degrees Celsius in 5 degree increments, with 5 samples being printed in each temperature increment. The testing samples will be the ASTM Type IV Dog Bone Testing Sample found on Thingiverse.com, however modifications will be made to allow for this test such as holes drilled into the top and bottom of the specimen and a thinner cross section. Since I am not able to access true testing equipment, I will be performing the tests using a stand, hooks to hang the sample from, and weights will be hung from the bottom of the sample to achieve a load. Each sample will be recorded using a video tape to watch deformation over time. Markings applied to the test section will be measured to see overall elongation, and each test will be run until the sample is broken.

Analysis will include averaging the results, finding a standard deviation for the samples, and determining which orientation and temperature are best to yield mechanically strong PLA parts.
