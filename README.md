# MAE-301-Project
This will be a repository containing data and results from a hypothesis experiment testing the effects of temperature and orientation on 3D printed PLA dog bone samples.

Hypothesis: By raising the temperature of the print material and having a print orientation parallel to the applied load, a 3D printed structure made of PLA plastic will be able to withstand higher stress and strain loads.

Testing will involve printing 20 specimens for each orientation, flat on the print bed and upright, and with each set of 20 specimens being divided into 5 specimens for each print temperature sub-group. Print temperature will be varied from 180-210 degrees Celsius at increments of 10 degrees, thus making up the 4 sub-groups for temperature testing. The testing samples will be the ASTM Type IV Dog Bone Testing Sample found on Thingiverse.com. Testing will occur in the material testing lab at the Urban Systems Engineering building at ASU's Tempe Campus. Each sample will be placed in the tensile testing machine and tests will be run until the specimen breaks. The data collected from these tests will be parsed for the maximum stress that each sample underwent before breaking.

The analysis will take the parsed maximum stress data collected, and a two-way anova test will be run to obtain the F-statistics. These statistics will determine whether temperature and/or orientation have any true affects on the ability of the 3D printed specimen being able to carry larger loads.
